# Batch converter

This is a small quality of life converter for Sonoff RF Bridge.

It's built upon https://tasmota.github.io/docs/devices/Sonoff-RF-Bridge-433/#sending-commands-with-portisch-firmware
and https://github.com/henfri/bitbuckedconverter/blob/master/BitBucketConverter

But with some quality of life additions so it's faster to convert codes.
